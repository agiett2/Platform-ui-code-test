Description
Hi, and welcome to the team! As you know, we provide tools for searching for doctors and hospitals (i.e. "providers"). A new feature has been requested by the client. Here is the business story:

As a consumer, I want to see a list of providers each contained by a card. These providers can be pinned to a "saved list" to be easily referenced. The unselected provider data defined in the list component should be used in place of an API.

Acceptance Criteria:

Unselected providers can be clicked and sent to a selected list.
Selected providers can be removed by clicking an X on the provider's card.
When providers are removed from the selected list, they should go back to the unselected list.
The state of both lists should be retained when the app is reloaded.
Unit tests should be added to cover new functionality.
Installation
